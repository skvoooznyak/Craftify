Disclaimer!
This build contains only legal mods for most servers, later I will post a link to additional technical mods.

Top-level optimization and fast access to servers are already available, which I can recommend in the long run.

In the future, I plan to develop this assembly by adding more and more new modifications and graphical changes 
to the UI, as well as localization into all languages ​​close to us

I express my deep gratitude to everyone who supported me, be sure to join the discord. 

Thank you all and enjoy the game!
